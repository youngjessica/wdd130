    <p>Hi friends! My name is Jess, and I am excited to be here with you all this semester.I'm a Web Design and Development major, and I have 4 semesters left until I graduate! </p>

        <p>I live in Ohio, so about 2 hours ahead of all of you wonderful Idaho and Utah friends. My husband and I have been married for 11 years, and we have 3 adorably rambunctious kiddos, 8, 6, and 2. I completed the Pathway program a few years ago and matriculated into the BYU-I online program and averaged about 1 class a semester while I was still running and teaching at my own dance studio. After 7-years of teaching dance, I closed my studio and started school full-time, and here I am.</p>
        
        <p>I really love the design aspect of web development. I have really enjoyed all my graphic art courses I've taken and learning how to use all the Adobe programs. I hope to be able to create with them in my future career. My dream job would be to work for company as like a digital organizer or presenter. If someone gave me files of information and visual assets such as logos and images and asked me to create a slide presentation or visual aids for their website or presentation, I'd be in career heaven!</p> 
        
        <p>I look forward to learning with you all this semester. Good luck!</p>

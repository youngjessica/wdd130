                <h2>What are temples?</h2>
                <p class="temples-p">For Latter-Day saints, temples are considered the literal houses of the Lord. They are sacred buildings where we can make and keep sacred promises with God, can feel the Holy Spirit, and can find peace and comfort from the world we live in. Temples have existed throughout history, serving as sacred places for God's children to worship. In the Old Testament, Moses had a tabernacle, Solomon built a temple, and in the New Testament Jesus taught in the temple. Today The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has built 140 temples worldwide and has many more in various phases of construction. Inside these sacred buildings, members learn sacred truths, participate in baptizing and serving ancestors who died without receiving such blessings, and are married for eternity. The blessings from attending and worthily serving in the house of the Lord are abundant. The peace and comfort that comes from participating in the sacred work of the temple is priceless.</p>

                <h2>The Columbus, Ohio Temple</h2>
                <p class="cotemp-p">On April 25th 1988, then president of the church Gordon B. Hinckley, announced the plans to construct the Columbus, Ohio Temple. Ground broke on September 12th, 1988, and was first dedicated and open for active temple service on September 4th, 1999. On August 5th 2020, renovation began for this beautiful house of the Lord to strengthen its structure. It was determined that, due to the materials from which the building was first built, mold and other compromising factors were the reason behind the need for renovations. On June 4th 2023, the newly renovated Columbus, Ohio temple was re-dedicated by Elder M. Russell Ballard, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>

                <h1>Open House & Rededication</h1>
                <p class="reno-p">Beginning Saturday April 29th and extending until May 13th 2023, the newly renovated Columbus Ohio temple was open to the public for an open house. During this open house, anyone of any age, race, social class, and religious or non-religious beliefs was given the opportunity to tour this beautiful building. 

                    During the two weeks of the open house events, many local prominent leaders of Ohio attended, including the Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewine. He said, in a media day at the temple at the start of the open house, “It’s a very, very peaceful place. “I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to go through the temple and have the explanation of the different rooms. “I think the emphasis on family is so very important.”
            
                    The re-dedication of the Columbus Ohio Temple occurred on Sunday, June 4th 2023. Elder M. Russell Ballard, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, came from Salt Lake City and presided over the ceremony including giving the sacred dedicatory prayer over the temple and enacting the building as an official house of the Lord and ready for active services. The state of Ohio has over 67,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, all of whom are invited to utilize the Columbus Ohio temple in their lives. Ohio will soon have its second LDS temple erected in Cleveland, Ohio after its construction and dedication.

                <h1>Renovations</h1>
                <p class="reno-p">On August 15th 2020, the Columbus Ohio Temple began its two and a half year journey of renovations and upgrades. It is said that the original work to build the temple did not include measures to combat the moist and humid atmosphere of Ohio. Therefore, including other measures to ensure the strength and longevity of the temple, renovations began. 

                    Updates and upgrades including new climate control improvements to the exterior walls of the temple, as well as acoustics to create a more reverent environment on the inside of the building have been done. Other updates include more natural light being brought to many of the rooms by enlarging many windows and adding additional art glass throughout the temple. 
                    
                    A new entrance, decorated with gold pillars invites all to come to participate in this sacred building. A new and larger coat room and show area has been included as well as a spacious waiting area for friends.

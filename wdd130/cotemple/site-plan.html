      <h4>What are temples?</h4>
      <p>
       For Latter-Day Saints, temples are considered literal houses of the Lord. They are sacred buildings where we can make and keep sacred promises with God, can feel the Holy Spirit, and can find peace and comfort from the world we live in.

       Temples have existed throughout history, serving as sacred places for God’s children to worship. In the Old Testament Moses had a tabernacle, Solomon built a temple, in the New Testament Jesus taught in the temple. Today, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has built 140 temples worldwide and has many more in various stages of construction. 

       Inside these sacred buildings, the members learn sacred truths, participate in baptizing and serving ancestors who died without receiving such blessings, and are married for eternity. The blessings from attending and worthily serving in the house of the Lord are abundant. The peace and comfort that comes from participating in the sacred work of the temple is priceless.

      <h4>The Columbus Ohio Temple</h4>
      <p> 
      On April 25th 1998, then president of the church Gordon B. Hinckley, announced the plans to construct the Columbus Ohio Temple. Ground broke on September 12th 1998, and was first dedicated and open for active temple service on September 4th 1999. On August 15th 2020, renovation began for this beautiful house of the Lord to strengthen its structure. It was determined that due to the materials form which the building was first built, mold and other compromising factors were the reason behind the need to renovate and strengthen the temple. 

      On June 4th, 2023 the newly renovated Columbus Ohio Temple was re-dedicated by Elder M. Russell Ballard, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

      <h3>Renovations</h3>
      <p>On August 15th 2020, the Columbus Ohio Temple began its two and a half year journey of renovations and upgrades. It is said that the original work to build the temple did not include measures to combat the moist and humid atmosphere of Ohio. Therefore, including other measures to ensure the strength and longevity of the temple, renovations began. 

        Updates and upgrades including new climate control improvements to the exterior walls of the temple, as well as acoustics to create a more reverent environment on the inside of the building have been done. Other updates include more natural light being brought to many of the rooms by enlarging many windows and adding additional art glass throughout the temple. 
        
        A new entrance, decorated with gold pillars invites all to come to participate in this sacred building. A new and larger coat room and show area has been included as well as a spacious waiting area for friends.

      <h3>Open House & Rededication</h3>
      <p>
        Beginning Saturday April 29th and extending until May 13th 2023, the newly renovated Columbus Ohio temple was open to the public for an open house. During this open house, anyone of any age, race, social class, and religious or non-religious beliefs was given the opportunity to tour this beautiful building. 

        During the two weeks of the open house events, many local prominent leaders of Ohio attended, including the Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewine. He said, in a media day at the temple at the start of the open house, “It’s a very, very peaceful place. “I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to go through the temple and have the explanation of the different rooms. “I think the emphasis on family is so very important.”

        The re-dedication of the Columbus Ohio Temple occurred on Sunday, June 4th 2023. Elder M. Russell Ballard, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, came from Salt Lake City and presided over the ceremony including giving the sacred dedicatory prayer over the temple and enacting the building as an official house of the Lord and ready for active services. The state of Ohio has over 67,000 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, all of whom are invited to utilize the Columbus Ohio temple in their lives. Ohio will soon have its second LDS temple erected in Cleveland, Ohio after its construction and dedication.
